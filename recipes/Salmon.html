            Quick delicious dinner in less than 30 minutes!
            After a short novel about how wonderful this food is, I'll finally get to the recipe.
            <strong>Dont't worry!</strong> There will only be twenty or thirty adds that block your view <em>at all times!</em>

            Long ago in a kitchen far far away my mother, father, wife, neighbor, and random house troll all loved this recipe.
            It was so <em><u>quick and amazing</u></em> it broke the <strong>fabric</strong> of reality!

            Final line of <strong>pointless</strong> <em>rambling</em> until I finally get to the <u>damn recipe!</u>
